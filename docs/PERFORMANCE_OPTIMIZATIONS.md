## üìä Overall Performance Impact

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-offs

### Visual Quality
- Slightly less sharp on high-DPI displays (pixel ratio 1.25 vs 2.0)
- Hexagonal edges instead of round (6 vs 16 segments) - barely noticeable
- No anti-aliasing (compensated by outline pass)

### Network
- Slightly less smooth remote player movement (20Hz vs 24Hz)
- Slightly larger position/rotation deltas before updates

### Physics
- Slightly less accurate collision detection (fewer solver iterations)
- Still maintains excellent gameplay feel

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

1. **Visual Quality Check**
   - Verify edges still look good at 6 segments
   - Ensure outline pass provides sufficient edge definition
   - Check ground appearance with basic material

2. **Performance Profiling**
   - Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab
   - Monitor frame times (should be <16ms for 60fps)
   - Check GPU usage in browser task manager

3. **Network Testing**
   - Verify smooth interpolation with 20Hz updates
   - Test on poor connections (simulate latency)

4. **Physics Testing**
   - Verify collisions still feel responsive
   - Test jump mechanics and edge cases
   - Ensure no tunneling issues

## üîÆ Future Optimization Opportunities

If more performance is needed:

1. **Dynamic Quality Scaling**
   - Further reduce pixel ratio on FPS drops
   - Disable outline pass temporarily
   - Reduce target count

2. **LOD (Level of Detail)**
   - Use even simpler geometry for distant targets
   - Cull targets outside view frustum

3. **Occlusion Culling**
   - Don't render targets behind walls

4. **Instanced Rendering**
   - Batch draw calls for targets (already has pooling)

5. **Web Workers**
   - Offload network processing to worker thread

## üìù Notes for Future Developers

- These optimizations maintain the game's visual identity
- Performance was prioritized over unnecessary visual fidelity
- All changes maintain backwards compatibility
- Material pools and spatial grids were already well-optimized
